*A fork of [AnoMech](https://github.com/anomek/AnoMech) by Anomek*

NatMech is AnoMech with extra strats, installed as a separate plugin so it can sit next to the
original. Open it with `/natmech` (or `/nat`).

Changes from AnoMech:
- Dancing Mad P3 Black Hole: **D>S>A double tethers** strat (modified DSA: Support 1 solo + DPS 1
  both tethers in BH1, Support 3 both tethers + DPS 3 solo in BH4).
- Dancing Mad P3 Black Hole: optional **tether guide**, an on-screen drawing of the tether(s) the
  selected strat gives you, where to step onto the beam, and where to hold it. Turn it on under
  Scenario settings; it draws solo and for a multiplayer host.
- Dancing Mad P3 Black Hole: **callouts** worded like cactbot's (Get North tether, Get both
  tethers, Pass tether), as on-screen text and optionally the Windows voice. The sim never reaches
  ACT/IINACT, so cactbot itself can't call it.
- **Pause**: a Pause/Resume button next to Stop, or `/nat pause` (bind it to a macro for a hotkey).
  Outside multiplayer only.

### Install NatMech

In Dalamud Settings → Experimental → Custom Plugin Repositories, add:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natluenthaisong/NatMech/master/repo.json
```

Save, then install **NatMech** from the plugin installer.

Licensed under AGPL-3.0, like the original; see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). The rest of this README
is the original AnoMech documentation.

*Another FFXIV mechanics simulator*

---
 
Simulate FFXIV raid mechanics client-side for solo practice. Go to any Inn, open the plugin with `/anomech` and start practicing!


Thanks to improvemnts by [WorstAquaPlayer](https://github.com/WorstAquaPlayer) plugin is quite stable now! No more 
crashes after training session.

**WARNING!!!**

**You are cut off from server traffic while in the sim zone.** To keep the
fake zone stable, the plugin firewalls incoming packets from the server.  
While simulating:
  * Players joining or leaving your party will not appear in the party list
  until you leave the sim zone.
  * Ready checks will not pop.
 

### Beta: Advanced Simulation Resolution

The simulator now includes a beta feature that properly resolves most skills, triggers, and gauges during simulation. 
As this feature is still in beta, some edge cases and less common interactions may not yet resolve correctly.

## Details

* Spawns fake party members and boss NPCs into the live game client
* Drives their positions, cast bars, tethers, and VFX so mechanics play out visually
* Your fake party members are full fledged bots that will do mechanics.  
  Some scanarios also have solo mode where you can practice without disctractions.


## How to help
1. Please provide feedback and report any issues in scenarios: bad timing, damage, config not working at it supposed
2. Bot AI currently only covers strategies from my region. Adding strategies for other regions requires little coding.
   Feel free to create pull request or contact me.
3. Adding new scenario is more involved. `tools/parser.py` generates a baseline scenario from a log, which still
   needs randomization, mechanic-failure logic and bot AI added by hand.
4. Plugin-development or reverse-engineering help, and improvement ideas, are also welcome.


## Known issues
* Minor visual and timing issues may occur
* In scenarios for Top Omega Protocol (Ultimate):
  * Tether distance threshold are very rough estimations
  * Line AOE from Optiocal Unit (eye) doesn't render
* Not all skills will resolve properly

#  Acknowledgments

Thanks for contributors:
* [WorstAquaPlayer](https://github.com/WorstAquaPlayer) - rewriting core & fixing crashes, scenarios for uwu
* [Wydox](https://github.com/Wydox) - EU strats for Forsaken, UMAD Exaflares, core improvements
* [RoarkGit](https://github.com/RoarkGit) - UMAD Celestriad, UCOB exas, win streaks

AnoMech leans heavily on the work of other Dalamud plugins. Huge thanks to their authors!  
Without them, the following would not be possible:

* **Hyperborea** — solo duty arena loading.
* **FFXIV-RaidsRewritten** — stunning the player on death and playing raid VFX.
* **bossmod** — mechanics timings and positions.
